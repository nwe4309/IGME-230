## I. High Concept:
	You play as a red circle who plays and travels through many different game genres.

## II. Genre:
	The game will consist of many different genres. Ranging from maze, platformer, bullet-hell, shoot ‘em up, dungeon crawler, and rhythm

## III. Platform:
	Desktop only

### IV. Story:
	Premise: You are a red circle who is on an adventure through many different genres and play styles.
	The overall theme of the game is dark and torch lit. The game will take place in a dungeon setting. The mood is slightly mysterious as at first the player doesn’t know which genre is next. As well the mood is more light-hearted because after all, you are just a red circle on a crazy adventure. The player progresses by completing a level with a certain genre play style and the goal is to reach the end of a series of levels to defeat a final boss of the specific genre.
	The players motivation is to complete three levels of each genre then a final boss of each genre.

## V. Esthetics:
	Graphic Style – Simple, cartoony
	Sound – 8-bit
	There will be different background music depending on the genre you are currently in but the sound effects will be similar across all genres.

## VI. Gameplay:
	### Mechanics: 
    The gameplay depends on the specific genre the player is in.
	#### Maze: 
    The player will move through a maze top-down with fog following them and only allowing a small amount of visibility around the player. If the player at any time bumps into a wall they will be knocked back. In the later levels of the maze genre, if the player bumps into an obstacle, the player will be sent back to the beginning of the maze.
	#### Platformer: 
    The player will able to move left and right and jump in a 2D-sidescroller fashion. The goal is to go right and reach the end of the level with the most points. To do so the player jumps over and on platforms and jumps on enemies and collect coins. Jumping on enemies and collecting coins increases the players score. Each time the player touches an enemy or falls off the level, they go back to the beginning.
	#### Bullet-hell: 
    The player will move in all 8 cardinal directions in a top down view while trying to avoid attacks in a certain pattern for a certain duration of time. If the player is hit then the level will reset and the player must start again.
	#### Shoot ‘em up: 
    The player will move in all 8 cardinal directions in a top down view while shooting at on coming enemies and dodging their attacks. The player will complete the level after a certain number of enemies have been defeated. In later levels, power ups will randomly spawn which will help the player. If the player is hit then the level will reset.
	#### Dungeon crawler: 
    The player will move in all 8 cardinal directions in a top down view. The player will move through different rooms fighting enemies and searching for treasure chests. The loot collected from the treasure chests will help in the later levels of the same genre.
	#### Rhythm: 
    The player will move left and right between 4 different lanes in a top down view. The player will press space while in a lane and when a note is close to them in order to score points. The more accurate the player is the more points earned. The goal is to finish a song with the highest score possible. For the first level if the player misses more than 10 notes in a row, the player must restart the level / song. In later levels the number of allowed notes missed in a row decreases.

  ### Controls:
	    Keyboard
	#### Maze: 
    WASD to move
	#### Platformer: 
    AD to move, space to jump
	#### Bullet-hell: 
    WASD to move
	#### Shoot ‘em up: 
    WASD to move, space to shoot
	#### Dungeon crawler: 
    WASD to move, space to attack
	#### Rhythm: 
    AD to move, space to hit note

	### Teaching the game: 
    The first level of each genre will be relatively easy and the basic controls for the specific level will be translucent and located in the top left corner for the player to glance at. As well a more detailed set of controls and instructions will be located anytime in the options menu of the paused game.

	### Player learning: 
    For the maze the player must learn how to efficiently navigate a maze and avoid obstacles. For the platformer the player must learn how to efficiently jump on platforms and dodge obstacles and attacks. For the bullet-hell the player must learn the attack patterns and be able to dodge the on coming bullets. For the shoot ‘em up the player must learn how to balance dodging attacks and attack back. For the dungeon crawler the player must learn to see how an enemy attacks before going for the kill. For the rhythm levels, the players must learn how to keep rhythm and remain accurate.
