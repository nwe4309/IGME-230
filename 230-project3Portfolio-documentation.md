## Sources:
  All images are created and belong to me.
  
  ### Framework:
    I used Bootstrap as my framework. I used it to help position the nav bar and make it responsive.
    
  ### Above & Beyond:
    For above and beyond I made it so that instead of all the content being on one big page
    that you have to scroll through, clicking on the nav button hides and unhides the content
    depending on the current page. As well, I made it so that the images in the projects page are
    clickable and when they are clicked the hide the other images and display more information
    about the clicked project. To back out of the current project, you can click on the projects nav
    button.
    
  ### Challenge
    The only part that I found a little challenging was when I was trying to make it so the project
    images wrapped without having one of them stretch across the whole screen.
